  * Probabilistic Record Linkage Algorithm
  * Deterministic Record Linkage Algorithm
  * Calculates distance between zip code centroids for use in probabilistic algorithm.
  * Jaro-Winkler string comparison (with prefix and long-string adjustments)
  * Phonetic name matching (Double Metaphone, NYSIIS and Soundex)
  * Approximate string matching and spelling distance algorithms
  * Nickname matching
  * Gender imputation for 20,000 names
  * Scaling of name weights (“Smith” receives less weight than “Freud”)
  * Powerful interface for manual review
  * Generates random samples of linked records for user validation of the process
  
### Additional Features in The Link King v4.0

  * "Presto" the data formatting wizard virtually eliminates the need to format your input dataset
  * Completely revised easy-to-follow instruction manual
  * Link/Unduplicate datasets of virtually ANY size (up to  99,999,999 records).
  * New Preliminary Data Reports and Processing Protocols: Conserve CPU and Disk requirements when blocking and comparing
  * Prevent linking errors before they occur
  * Identify and eliminate "bad" SSN and DOBs
  * Conserve CPU and disk usage with "alias compression" Prior to blocking The Link King will use our new "alias compression" protocol to minimize resource use in blocking & comparing records.  If your data has a lot of aliases, this feature can save a lot of time.
  * Create a "master" roster and update it as new information becomes available. Once a "master roster" is created and a “uniqueid” is established through Consolidation of your source data, the master roster can be re-input into The Link King as the “sample” and newly matched records will be appended without changing the original value for “uniqueid”
  * After mapping, the updated "master roster" will contain: All records originally in the "master roster" with newly matched records “folded” into the  preexisting uniqueid.

  * Optionally, all unmatched records in the “matching” dataset will be appended and the “uniqueid” incremented as necessary.
  * Enhanced interface for manual review of uncertain pairs
  * Enhanced interface for manual review of cross-links (aka "chained links")
  * Enhanced Artificial Intelligence
