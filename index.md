### Record Linkage and Consolidation Software

In the realm of record linkage and unduplication software (aka. dedupe
software), The Link King reigns supreme.  The Link King has fashioned a
powerful alliance between sophisticated probabilistic record linkage and
deterministic record linkage protocols incorporating [features](http://the-link-king.party/features.html) unavailable in
many proprietary record linkage programs. ([detailed overview (pdf)](http://www2.sas.com/proceedings/sugi30/020-30.pdf))

The Link King’s probabilistic record linkage protocol was adapted from
the algorithm developed by MEDSTAT for the Substance Abuse and
Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) Integrated Database
Project.  The deterministic record linkage protocols were developed at
Washington State’s Division of Alcohol and Substance Abuse for use in a
variety of evaluation and research projects.

The Link King’s graphical user interface (GUI) makes record linkage and
unduplication easy for beginning and advanced users.  The data linking
neophyte will appreciate the easy-to-follow instructions.  The Link King's
artificial intelligence will assist in the selection of the most appropriate
linkage/unduplication protocol.  The technical wizard will appreciate the
discussion of data linkage/unduplication issues in The Link King’s user
manual, the variety of user-specified options for blocking and linkage
decisions, and the powerful interface for manual review of “uncertain”
linkages.

The Link King requires a base SAS license but NO SAS programming
experience.  ***If you have a SAS dataset, a SPSS portable file, an EXCEL
spreadsheet, or a comma/tab delimited file, The Link King can do the rest.***  
The Link King v6.4 requires SAS v9.0 or higher but v6.3 is compatible
with SAS v8.
